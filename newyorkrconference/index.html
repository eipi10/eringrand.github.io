Day 1

How R Helps Airbnb Make the Most of Its Data

Ricardo Bion, Airbnb


AirBnD started in 2008 with 1 city and 1 room, now there are 3M homes in 71K cities
100+ data scietists using a mix of lanaguages mostly R, but lots of python
Why to use an R Packages:


Passing around functions required duplication of work, where as a package can include data, test, add-ins, vignettes, R markdown and notebook templates
The AirBnB packages have consistent API, branded visualization, branded templates, and of course function functions

Education:


made a difference in confidence of R stats
new hire buddy
intro classes at datacamp if interested, sponsored by airbnb
peer support with office hours, code review, R slack group
learning lunch, journal club, offsites

Reproducibility:


scale knowedlge
knowledge repo
posts have tags with topics, date, then served as a web ui
uses github for peer review
branded template
incorprate best practices from academia and software

Fine Grained Visual Category Recognition and Perceptual Embedding

Serge Belongie, Cornell University


Really intersting talk on using Stochastic Neighbor algorithm with crowd sourcing to get a visual similarity of images.
Motivation of humans and computers working together
His talk focused on detecting what type of bird was in an image
Detecting that there is a bird in the picture is getting easy for computer, but detecting the exact name of the bird is much more difficult

An R Cloud Computing Lifeline: The Missing Manual for Running R on Amazon Cloud

Kelly O&#39;Briant, B23 


Working with R in the cloud is different from working with Rstudio on your computer, you have to install all your favroite packages again every time you start up a new server
 bigger instances sizes, analysis while sleeping, running multiple R servers at the same time, instances themselves are disaposable and renewable resources
able to use tools in a more powerful manor


@b23kelly created a custom R package to set up new projects/deployed servers fast without having to reconfigure anew each time #rstatsnyc&mdash; Alec Barrett (@alecbarrett) April 21, 2017



R Makes the World Go &#39;Round: Data-Driven Decision Making at JetBlue

Catherine Zhou, JetBlue

One of the interesting take always throughout the conference was that you can start coding in R pretty quickly, if you start with the right ideas and tools about what R is. Most intro stats classes (mine included) treat R and other programming languages as a calculator. But R is so much more than that! Catherine Z made a point about giving people templates with tidyverse functions to produce their own analyses. In my own work, I&#39;m helping my coworker think of tidyverse in a similar way to computing excel tasks, i.e group_by()  %&gt;% summarise() is equivalent to a pivot table, and mutate() adds a new column the same you way you might by drag-and-dropping an excel equation.

There were also several good comments on how you can learn slowly by doing something small in R (such as doing a bit of cleaning) and then porting it back out to excel or tableau to finish your analysis. Best takeaway? Not everyone needs to be fluent in R. - Catherine

Fun with R

Jared P. Lander, Lander Analytics

Harnessing the Power of JavaScript for Data Science

Ramnath Vaidyanathan, DataCamp


Ramnath switched talk time with Dan, so my order is slightly different from what you may see online.


We R What We Ask: The Landscape of R Users on Stack Overflow

David Robinson, Stack Overflow


Stack Overflow susers




Theoretical Statistics is the Theory of Applied Statistics: How to Think About What We Do

Andrew Gelman, Columbia

Reiterating Andrew Gelman&#39;s point about how p-value statistical testing is actually a pretty bad framework for hypothesis testing most of the time. time to really brush up on Bayesian stats. I also liked the general point that you should have to state what you expect to find (alternate hypotheses, estimated effect sizes, whatever) before you go barging around looking for anything and act like whatever you end up with is what you were searching for all along.

The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Empathy - The killer skill needed for a successful technical career

JD Long, RenaissanceRe


Analysis doesn&#39;t end at result delivery - it ends at developing and proselytizing new business strategies and innovation.
Automating Excel workflows can be a first step towards bringing R to a team.
Agile development tells user stories as an empathy hack.

As a ______
I want ______
So I can ______ 


Person-level stories (the near) are always more meaningful than data stories (the far). We need to balance both as Data Scientists.
In development, we need to have an actual user in mind, rather than a theoretical user who wants everything.


&quot;As you tell your data stories, think about the individual people in your data and your consumers&quot; - @CMastication #rstatsnyc pic.twitter.com/f9DZGCprDO&mdash; Emily Robinson (@robinson_es) April 21, 2017



Experience R in the Cloud: Empower Insurance Operations from Insights to Action

Catherine Cao, IBM

R - From Backend to Production

Reenah Nahum Muldavski, Bidalgo

Things about the Future and the Future of Things

Deborah Berebichez, Discovery Channel

R in Financial Services: Challenges and Opportunities

Lixun Zhang, Microsoft

Day 2

Publication Hacking: How We Answered a Research Question and Wrote a Manuscript in Only Two Days

Sandy Griffith, Flatiron Health

The Humble Programmer Data Scientist: Essence and Accident in Software Engineering Data Science

Friederike Schuur, Fast Forward Labs

So You Want to be a Data Scientist?

Dan Chen, Virginia TechQL


Working with SQL in R is easy with library(RPostgress)


Using Human Mobility Data to Assess Public Circulation Health

Michael Kane


talking about cell phone tower data -&gt; homan ciculatory data
anytime you are connecting or handing off to a cell phone tower, the data is logged
secruity at: IDS are all hashed version of cell phones
35 TB data set! big! 10 GB every day
touching ALL of the day when doing analysis
use R, with Hadoop
using HMR in cluster (hapood)
looks at inflow and outflow counts (flux)
are providing reliable information on human mobility on storms


- want the learner that is the most REGULAR not the closest to accuracy

From Agreeing to Marching to Organizing: OSS Needs You

Mike Malecki and Neal Richardson


Best ways to contribute to open source are to start with improving documentation
Open source contributions: failing test with fix &gt; failing test &gt; bug report
Remember to include sessionInfo()
When releasing a package, release quickly, but also slowly - take time to fix dumb decisions


Bring something new to the community, but don&#39;t reinvent the wheel 
Tell people about your package (social media), then listen to how they&#39;re using it
When thinking about a package: documentation &gt; usability &gt; performance &gt; features



threejs: less cruft, more awesome!

Bryan Lewis
A talk not about mushrooms

Enabling reproducibility at scale with R and Pachyderm

Dan Whitenack

True #reproducibility requires versioning of data not just code. #rstatsnyc #rstats @dwhitena pic.twitter.com/oXKBJ59FqU&mdash; Joyce Robbins (@jtrnyc) April 22, 2017



Building a Predictive Early Intervention System to Prevent Adverse Police Incidents

Jon Keane, Mattersight

Better Packages through Peer Review: Lessons from rOpenSci.

Noam Ross, ROpenSci

Difference between peer review and code review: broad rather than narrow scope; legitimacy along with quality #rstatsnyc @noamross pic.twitter.com/nYVpREj4aq&mdash; David Robinson (@drob) April 22, 2017



Towards Interoperable Data Frames

Wes McKinney, Two Sigma

Text Mining, the Tidy Way

Julia Silge, Stack Overflow

RStudio Tips and Tricks

Sean Lopp, RStudio

Don&#39;t Let Lawyers Ruin Your Analytics

Jim Klucar, Immuta

Automation + Systems

Automating what you can:
rationalizing plots/routine outputs saves SO much time and seems like it makes it so much easier to on-board new folks. (basically reiterating The Word that @catherine_pargeter preached on Tuesday)

Introducing New People to R:


keep a list of things you do
port as much of the &quot;easy&quot; things you can into R
data cleaning


Once you&#39;ve built the ground work, you can move into doing more complicated analyses 

Other Learnings

I spent most of the conference chatting and meeting other members of the Rladies New York chapter. 



Packages to Try Out


RXKCD: add XKCD cartoons to stuff!
trelliscope: many-panel data vis
compareGroups: compare demographics and other aspects across groups
goodpractice: does a variety of checking for good package development practice
lintr: helps check for good code style
devtools::spellcheck()
emo
broom: turn analytics output into tidy data frames

<h3>From Agreeing to Marching to Organizing: OSS Needs You</h3>

<p>Mike Malecki and Neal Richardson</p>

<ul>
<li>Best ways to contribute to open source are to start with improving documentation</li>
<li>Open source contributions: failing test with fix &gt; failing test &gt; bug report</li>
<li>Remember to include sessionInfo()</li>
<li>When releasing a package, release quickly, but also slowly - take time to fix dumb decisions

<ul>
<li>Bring something new to the community, but don&#39;t reinvent the wheel </li>
<li>Tell people about your package (social media), then listen to how they&#39;re using it</li>
<li>When thinking about a package: documentation &gt; usability &gt; performance &gt; features</li>

<h2>Automation + Systems</h2>

<p>Automating what you can:
rationalizing plots/routine outputs saves SO much time and seems like it makes it so much easier to on-board new folks. (basically reiterating The Word that @catherine_pargeter preached on Tuesday)</p>

<h2>Introducing New People to R:</h2>

<ul>
<li>keep a list of things you do</li>
<li>port as much of the &quot;easy&quot; things you can into R</li>
<li>data cleaning</li>
</ul>

<p>Once you&#39;ve built the ground work, you can move into doing more complicated analyses </p>

<h1>Other Learnings</h1>

<p>I spent most of the conference chatting and meeting other members of the <a href="LINKLINKLINK">Rladies New York chapter</a>. </p>

<h1>Packages to Try Out</h1>

<ul>
<li>RXKCD: add XKCD cartoons to stuff!</li>
<li>trelliscope: many-panel data vis</li>
<li>compareGroups: compare demographics and other aspects across groups</li>
<li>goodpractice: does a variety of checking for good package development practice</li>
<li>lintr: helps check for good code style</li>
<li>devtools::spellcheck()</li>
<li>emo</li>
<li>broom: turn analytics output into tidy data frames</li>
