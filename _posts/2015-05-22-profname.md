title: What Name Do Grad Students Refer to Their Professors As? 
description:  At some point this past week, I came to the realization that of the professors I've had this year, I've only referred to the female professor by her first name in conversation with other students. I wondered if this was indicative of some larger issue, or if it's just because she's also our class advisor.

At some point this past week, I came to the realization that of the professors I've had this year, I've only referred to the female professor by her first name in conversation with other students. I wondered if this was indicative of some larger issue, or if it's just because she's also our class advisor.

I put together a quick and dirty survey to see what other students' experiences are, in how they refer to their professors. I posted the survey to twitter and facebook. 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I am interested if this indicative of some larger issue, or if it&#39;s just because she&#39;s also our class advisor. (2/?)</p>&mdash; Erin Grand (@astroeringrand) <a href="https://twitter.com/astroeringrand/status/600694453649682433">May 19, 2015</a></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I&#39;ve put together a quick survey to look into it. Please fill it out and/or pass it around! <a href="http://t.co/N4t3sB57kn">http://t.co/N4t3sB57kn</a> (3/?)</p>&mdash; Erin Grand (@astroeringrand) <a href="https://twitter.com/astroeringrand/status/600694784940990464">May 19, 2015</a></blockquote>

In the first 24 hours of the survey being posted to facebook and twitter there were 36 responses. 

I also received lots of great responses outside of the survey online such as:
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/merrdiff">@merrdiff</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/astroeringrand">@astroeringrand</a> I changed how I refer to them once I got into grad school.</p>&mdash; Laura Mayorga (@mayorgalc) <a href="https://twitter.com/mayorgalc/status/600705464498659328">May 19, 2015</a></blockquote>

and

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/astroeringrand">@astroeringrand</a> I always called them Professor/Dr. Last Name unless they want to be called Professor/Dr. First name.</p>&mdash; David Hamilton (@D_avidH) <a href="https://twitter.com/D_avidH/status/600697875400560641">May 19, 2015</a></blockquote>

Due to the end of the school year, and the start of my new internship I haven't had the time to go through the survey results yet. As soon as I can give the time to this project, I will write an update with the results.

If you're interested in going through the data yourself, I've made the results public to everyone at [this link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ya4_UxgW2oB1YXvE55QXQyEjgZBWpta3pjYujUKl3CQ/pubhtml).
