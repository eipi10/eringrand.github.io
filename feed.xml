        <title>Educational Graphics in Science</title>
        <description>&lt;h2&gt;Educational graphics:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Educational graphics are often used as a way to teach one concept. As such, they tend to generalize the information in such a way that leaves out important information. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take, for example the standard evolution depiction: 
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/Human-Evolution-460x233.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Evolution image&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We use this image as a teaching tool, because it&amp;#39;s easy to visual evolution this way.
However, the graphic, isn&amp;#39;t accurate in it&amp;#39;s depiction of evolution because due to the simplicity of the graphic there is no knowledge of time, species extinction, 
A better graphic would be able to easily show all of this information. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The image below does a little better by including time information as well as showing the full evolution tree. This graphic makes clear the complex nature of evolution, but still leaves out many extinction events. (Click
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lucasbrouwers.nl/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/Evo_large.gif&quot;&gt;
here
&lt;/a&gt;
to see a larger version of this image.)
&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.lucasbrouwers.nl/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/Evo_large.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Example evolution graphic&quot; width=&quot;650px&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For an example of commonly used well depicted graphic, we have this image showing the structure of the terrestrial planets. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/terrestrial_interiors.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This graphic shows the relative size difference between the planets as well as their inside makeup. It even manages to show where we have incomplete information. 
There are lots of version of this graphic, but I think this one works the best because it uses labels and lines sparingly in place of a color coded legend. &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>March Gladness at Tab For a Cause</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Starting March 13th the college groups on Tab for a Cause will be competing in a bracket style
tournament for &amp;quot;charitable supremacy!&amp;quot;
For more on the tournament: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tabforacause.org/blog/2015/03/02/march-gladness-tabbing-tournament-charity/&quot;&gt;click here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Uncertain by what Tab For a Cause is and why you should care? Continue reading! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tabforacause.org/?r=11041284&quot;&gt;Tab for a Cause&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tab for a Cause is a free browser extension that raises money for charity with every new tab a user opens. 
After the user downloads the extension, the new tab page will be a customizable backdrop with widgets and 
a couple of banner advertisements in the corner. 
The money raised from these advertisements is donated to charity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Tab For a Cause FAWQ states:
&amp;quot;No matter what our costs are, we give at least half of our revenue to charity. 
Historically weâ€™ve given upwards of 90%. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;We use the rest of the revenue for two purposes: 

(1) to cover costs, which include hosting/server costs and food for our 
team;  
(2) to reinvest in getting more Tabbers so that we can give more to 
charity in the long term.&amp;quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How Do Groups Work?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you download the extension, you can see and join groups by going to your Dashboard (the speedometer button to the left on the page).&lt;br&gt;
To find a group use the search bar on the top of the dashboard. 
Once you have joined a group, your New Tab counts (heats) will be added to the group&amp;#39;s total 
in attempt to climb the &amp;quot;Top Groups&amp;quot; leader board.
You can also compete within your grop to see who is the &amp;quot;Top Tabber&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://tabforacause.org/?r=11041284&quot;&gt;Join me in this crazy competition to raise money for charity and see which school spends the most time randomly clicking around on the internet!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

        <title>Educational Content on YouTube</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;YouTube is well known as the website that hosts illegal music videos and cats, and while the 
cat videos are abundant and adorable, there&amp;#39;s been a new trend on YouTube toward channels 
and videos that offer viewers educational content as well as entertainment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My introduction to educational videos started with the general &amp;quot;How To&amp;quot; theme. 
I was able to find solutions to every question I had, from building a website, to
fixing the settings on my computer, 
or to doing my own laundry. (Sorry Mom, but I totally learned that from the internet.)
After spending years on YouTube mostly watching comedy bits and the aforementioned cat videos, 
I was finally introduced to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/user/vlogbrothers&quot;&gt;Vlogbrothers&lt;/a&gt; 
through their human sexuality &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXAoG8vAyzI&quot;&gt;video&lt;/a&gt;. 
In my mind, the John and Hank Green (of the Vlogbrothers) revolutionized YouTube. Their channel 
started in 2007 with Brotherhood 2.0 as a experiment for the brothers and entertainment for their viewers. 
As time went on, their videos started including more educational materials about history and current events.
In 2011, the brothers started what would become a long list of educational channels each with a different theme.
At the time of writing this, the Vlogbrothers have produced:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;www.youtube.com/user/scishow&quot;&gt;SciShow&lt;/a&gt; - a channel about all things science&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/user/scishowspace&quot;&gt;SciShow Space&lt;/a&gt; - a channel about all things astronomy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/user/crashcourse&quot;&gt;Crash Course&lt;/a&gt; - a series of playlists for topics at the level of high school course, 
so far there are playlists for:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrk4oY7UxpQ&amp;amp;list=PL8dPuuaLjXtOfse2ncvffeelTrqvhrz8H&quot;&gt;US Government and Politics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6E9WU9TGrec&amp;amp;list=PL8dPuuaLjXtMwmepBjTSG593eG7ObzO7s&quot;&gt;US History&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSYw502dJNY&amp;amp;list=PL8dPuuaLjXtOeEc9ME62zTfqc0h6Pe8vb&quot;&gt;Literture&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tq6be-CZJ3w&amp;amp;list=PL8dPuuaLjXtMczXZUmjb3mZSU1Roxnrey&quot;&gt;Big History&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rHUDWjR5gg&amp;amp;list=PL8dPuuaLjXtPAJr1ysd5yGIyiSFuh0mIL&quot;&gt;Astronomy&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBGl2BujkPQ&amp;amp;list=PL8dPuuaLjXtOAKed_MxxWBNaPno5h3Zs8&quot;&gt;Anatomy and Physiology&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/user/thebrainscoop&quot;&gt;Brain Scoop&lt;/a&gt; - a channel from the Chief Curiosity Correspondent of The Field Museum in Chicago about animals, 
biology, and other parts of science &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/user/thehealthcaretriage&quot;&gt;Healthcare Triage&lt;/a&gt; - a channel that focuses on providing health information where research is the main source&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/user/learnhowtoadult&quot;&gt;How to Adult&lt;/a&gt; - a channel that teaches basic thing they don&amp;#39;t teach in school about being an adult&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outside of the family of the Green brothers&amp;#39; channels, I also recommend: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/user/minutephysics&quot;&gt;Minute Physics&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/user/minuteearth&quot;&gt;Minute Earth&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/user/AsapSCIENCE&quot;&gt;AsapSCIENCE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/user/1veritasium&quot;&gt;Veritasium&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/user/MentalFlossVideo&quot;&gt;Mental Floss&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/user/ERB&quot;&gt;Epic Rap Battles of History&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it&amp;#39;s easy for everyone to have a YouTube channel, many of these educational channels 
have large operating costs which make them difficult to fund through advertising revenue alone. 
SciShow and CrashCourse were originally funded by a YouTube grant. 
As a way to support the operating costs of SciShow and CrashCourse after
their initial year, the Green brothers started the Crowdfunding site: 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://subbable.com/&quot;&gt;Subbable&lt;/a&gt;. Websites like Subbable and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.patreon.com/&quot;&gt;Patreon&lt;/a&gt;
allow for fans to support their favorite creators directly, and for creators to have 
a regular income  for their projects.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The popularity of these educational channels has not gone unnoticed by YouTube. The video hosting site
recently put a great deal of advertisement backing behind SciShow causing the channel to
grow substantially in viewship. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As educational content videos become more popular with viewers, educators 
are beginning to look to YouTube for supporting materials in the class room. SciShow and CrashCourse are
used in hundreds of classes around the world, and I often used Minuete Physics in my classes. 
The structure of the videos allows for the students to find entertainment and intest in the subject and for 
educators to expand upon their interest with activities related to the videos. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spend more time on Youtube then I care to admit, but through my love of online video have found 
a community of people who create great things and I&amp;#39;m happy to be a part of it. This past year 
I was lucky enough to attend Vidcon, the annual online video convention. I was pleasantly 
surprised that the educational content panel was one of the most packed
panels that I went to. I think this speak to what creators want to create and what viewers 
want to watch. I hope to see more educational based content being created in the near future. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, there are hundreds of wonderful educational channels out there and I encourage 
you to go look for them or to start your own. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I have produced one video on my channel so far, which you can watch &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leJuucunLak&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;! 
I hope to one day return and post more.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
