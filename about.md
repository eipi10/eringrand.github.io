* My work has focused on identifing drop off points for trainers and supervisors. I producied cohort reports of training metrics and identified key differences among cohorts to provide trainers with new solutions. I identified counselor churn as the largest organizational priority, and setup tracking, reporting, and analysis of key metrics.
