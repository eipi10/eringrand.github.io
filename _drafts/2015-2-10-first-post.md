I've spent some time recently re-watching watching episodes of [The Lizzie Bennet Diares](http://www.pemberleydigital.com/the-lizzie-bennet-diaries/)
(via the DVDs which I now own) and [Welcome to Sanition](http://www.pemberleydigital.com/welcome-to-sanditon/). 
In the modernized versions of these classic works, a major themes is that of following the right path for you, whether or not that path was the one you thought 
you were on. 
As someone, who was on a strict path for many years and has recently jumped ship, this topic is very relevant to me. 

I fell head over heels in love with space during a trip to a local observatory in rural Rhode Island. 
My love for astronomy, as a field, mixed my passion for math and physics with my awe for the beauty of space. 
I happily studied astronomy for fours years of college, even landing a dream intership at NASA,
which lead to my work being selected as the Astronomy Picture of the Day.

At the completion of two years in my first graduate program, I was in a situation where I wasn't
happy with my research project, the project did not have any funding, and felt that I had been 
in the same place for too long. 
I intended to transfer to an astronomy program with funded projects closer to my interests, 
in a different part of the country. As I began the application process, I was directed 
to the (then) Institute for Data Science at Columbia (now Data Science Insitiute).
