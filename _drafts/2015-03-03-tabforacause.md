##[Tab for a Cause](http://www.tabforacause.org/?r=11041284)

Tab for a Cause is a free browser extension that raises money for charity with every new tab a user opens. 
After the user downloads the extension, the new tab page will be a customizable backdrop with widgets and ads. 
The couple of banner advertisements in the corner open each time you open a New Tab. 
The moneys from these advertisements goes to charities.

The Tab For a Cause FAWQ states that
"No matter what our costs are, we give at least half of our revenue to charity. 
Historically weâ€™ve given upwards of 90%. 
We use the rest of the revenue for two purposes: 
(1) to cover costs, which include hosting/server costs and food for our team; and 
(2) to reinvest in getting more Tabbers so that we can give more to charity in the long term."



What are Hearts?

Hearts are a Tab for a Cause currency that you earn for opening tabs and referring new friends. You can then donate your Hearts to the charities that you would like to support. After gaining a certain number of Hearts, you level up!

What happens when I donate my Hearts?

When you donate a Heart, you are essentially casting a vote for money to be given to your selected charity. At the end of each quarter, we take all of the money raised through Tab for a Cause and divide it amongst the charities based on the number of Hearts that were donated to each cause during the quarter.




Where can I see and join groups?

You can see and join groups by going to your Stats Dashboard! Click the purple speedometer button to the left of your tab page, and then click "My Groups" in the menu that appears. To inquire about starting a group for your school/community, click "Create a Group" or email groups@tabforacause.org.


Do you endorse the companies in your ads?

No. Companies advertised with us have paid our ad network for a spot, and does not mean that Tab for a Cause endorses them. We don't choose specific ads ourselves (as awesome as that would be).

The funnel goes: Company --> Ad Network --> Your Tabs. Sometimes this means seeing an ad you disagree with, but the money still goes to the charity of your choice!
