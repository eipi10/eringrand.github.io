I often introduce myself as a "Profesional Student", this is because I have been in school, without a break longer than summer, for the last 9 years. Over this time period, one aspect of lectures has bugged me more than the rest. Why is world is every class example, involving people, based on GENDER?

Ie. 
- In a discussion of a netflix recomendation system, looking at "boy" movies and "girl" movies.
- Predicting the height of students, by looking at gender.
- Clustering communities into men and women 
- Refering to inanimate objects as "he" (mostly applied to computers - in the master, slave context which itself has problems)
