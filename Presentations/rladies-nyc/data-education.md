About Me (2 min)
========================================================

- Oringainly studied Astronomy and Physics 
- Studied Data Science at Columbia University (MS 2016)
- Teaching in grad school, reading education research papers, listening to friends -> fell in love with education data and research

What is a charter school? What is Uncommon Schools? (5min)
========================================================

- Publicly funded school that is run by a private non-profit company
- Uncommon schools has 52 schools across 5 regions (Boston, Newark, Brooklyn, Rochester, Troy)
- X # students, Y # teachers

What kind of data do we work with? (5 min)
========================================================

- Exams / assessments in class
- State exams (common core test)
- Class grades, attendance, suspensions, demographics
- Teacher data
- HR + recruitment information

Data Challenges(10min)
========================================================

- Missing data
- Un-connected-ness of different data sources (i.e HR to Teacher to Student)
- Students who change schools or teachers
- Human data reporting error
- Technology questions / problems
- Keeping historical / longitudinal data / quality of such

Cleaning data (10min)
========================================================

- Intro to Janitor, clean_names(), get_dupes
- Get_dupes + assertr
- Code samples of the above, especially duplicates of IDs
- What to do with missing data, example?

Janitor
========================================================

From the description file: 

Janitor was built with beginning-to-intermediate R users in mind and is optimized for user-friendliness. Advanced users can already do everything covered here, but they can do it faster with janitor and save their thinking for more fun tasks.

========================================================

You should be able to do everything inside janitor on your own, but we don't have the time to always clean up data without help.

Benefits to using Janitor over writing your own code
========================================================


- Functions are well tested
- Data obeys Hadley's official style guide
- Generally turn many lines of code into one or two (huzzah!)
- Pipe-able
- Written for the education data space

========================================================








Two main functions I use all the time:

- `clean_names()`
- `get_dupes()`

Other really usual functions:
========================================================

- `remove_empty_rows()` 
- `remove_empty_cols()`
- `excel_numeric_to_date()`


Example 
========================================================

```
read_excel(filepath, sheet="Sheet1", col_types = "text") %>%
  clean_names() %>%
  remove_empty_cols() %>%
  remove_empty_rows() %>%
  mutate_at(vars(entrydate, exitdate, student_id, yearsinuncommon), as.numeric) %>%
  mutate_at(vars(entrydate, exitdate), excel_numeric_to_date) %>%
  head()
```

Example projects: models (10min)
========================================================

- Cut scores, linear + trees
- Recruitment projections (logistic)
- Value added model - teacher effect (maybe)

Heping coworkers learn R, why is this important?
========================================================

- State tests - automation
- Started with base R for lists vs vector and index notation, then immeditly moved into tidyverse, mostly following R4DS chapters and material
- Worked in my own favorite packages, like janitor and assertr
- Keep everyone using a simple set of principles so everyone can read everyone elseâ€™s code
- Use my own mistakes as examples of what not to do
- Put all my materials online
